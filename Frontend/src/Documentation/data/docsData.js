  # Dataset & Backend
  
  ## Overview
  
  NyayaSathi's backend is the foundation that powers document understanding and AI interactions.
  
  It handles:
  
  - Document upload & preprocessing
  - Vectorization and embedding storage
  - Query routing and retrieval (RAG)
  - Simplification and translation API calls
  
  ## Data Preparation Pipeline
  
  **1.** Collect public Indian legal datasets (judgments, acts, case summaries).
  
  **2.** Clean & normalize text data (remove noise, section headers, duplicates).
  
  **3.** Split documents into chunks (~512 tokens).
  
  **4.** Generate embeddings using an embedding model (e.g., text-embedding-3-large).
  
  **5.** Store vectors in a database (e.g., Pinecone, MongoDB + Vector plugin).
  
  ## Backend Flow
  
  The complete processing pipeline:
  
  **User** ‚Üí **Upload Document** ‚Üí **Preprocessing** ‚Üí **Embedding** ‚Üí **Store in Vector DB** ‚Üí **Query** ‚Üí **Retrieve** ‚Üí **LLM Response** ‚Üí **Translation/Voice Output**
  
  ## APIs
  
  ### Core Endpoints
  
  - **/upload** ‚Äì Handles document uploads
  - **/query** ‚Äì Accepts user question + file ID and returns simplified answer
  - **/translate** ‚Äì Translates simplified output into target language
  
  ## Technology Stack
  
  Backend built with **Node.js + Express** and connected to **MongoDB**.
  
  ---
  
  ### Database Architecture
  
  - **MongoDB**: Stores user data, document metadata, and query history

  ### 5. Translator + TTS
  
  Converts responses into regional languages and adds voice output for accessibility.
  
  ## Simplified Flow
  
  The AI processing pipeline:
  
  **User Query**
  ‚Üì
  **Retriever** (fetch relevant chunks)
  ‚Üì
  **LLM** (Simplify + Summarize + Reference)
  ‚Üì
  **Translator** (Hindi/Marathi + Voice Output)
  ‚Üì
  **Response UI**
  
  ## Tech Stack
  
  ### Core Technologies
  
  - **LLM:** OpenAI GPT / Gemini / custom NLP model

  ### Future Development
  
  üöÄ **Planned Enhancement:** Fine-tuned LLM on Indian legal corpus for improved accuracy and context-specific understanding.
  
  ## Why RAG?
  
  Retrieval Augmented Generation ensures:
  
  - **Accuracy:** Responses backed by actual legal documents
  - **Transparency:** Citations and references for every answer
  - **Up-to-date:** Always uses the latest legal information from the database
  - **Cost-effective:** Only processes relevant document chunks instead of entire corpus
